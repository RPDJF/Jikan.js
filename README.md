**Jikan.js** is a **simple**, **efficient**, and **easy-to-use** library for
interacting with the [Jikan API](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan) — a RESTful
API that brings MyAnimeList data to your fingertips!

Built with ❤️ in TypeScript, Jikan.js is designed for Deno and comes with
powerful features like **rate-limiting**, **caching**, and **self-hosted API
support**. Whether you're building the next anime tracker or just want to fetch
your favorite characters, Jikan.js has you covered!

⚠️ **Heads up!** This library is still a work in progress. The first release is
coming soon, but you're welcome to follow along and share your feedback! 🙌

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Importing the Library

**Note:** This library isn’t on the Deno registry yet. Stay tuned for updates!

To try it out now:

```typescript
import { JikanClient } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPDJF/Jikan.js/refs/heads/main/src/index.ts";
```

### 🎯 Example Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the library to fetch data from the Jikan
API:

```typescript
const client = new JikanClient();

client.getCharacter(1).then((character) => {
  console.log(character.name);
});
```

You also can use your own self-hosted Jikan API:

```typescript
const client = new JikanClient({
  host: "https://my-jikan-api.com",
  baseUri: "/v4",
});
```

**Pro Tip**: Always handle errors gracefully:

```typescript
try {
  const character = await client.getCharacter(1);
  console.log(character.name);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

## 💬 What is Jikan API?

[Jikan API](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan) is an **unofficial MyAnimeList
API** that scrapes MAL data. It provides information on anime, manga,
characters, schedules, and more!

**Why Jikan over MAL’s official API?**

- More features (e.g., character & staff info).
- No weird rate limit mysteries.
- Community-driven goodness.

## 🌌 Why Deno?

Deno is **secure**, **fast**, and **modern** — the perfect playground for this
library! Plus, it’s a refreshing break from Node.js. 🦕

## 🛤️ What’s Next?

I’m just getting started! Stay tuned for more features and a polished first
release. Want to contribute or share ideas? Open an issue or fork the repo — I’d
love to learn from you! 😊
